In 1996, the [Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Orbiter_Laser_Altimeter) flew aboard [Mars Global Surveyor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Global_Surveyor). Using infrared laser pulses, it created a precise map of the planet's topography.

We're loading this data onto the awesome webgl-based [VoxelJS](http://voxeljs.com/) engine so that you can take a hike through Valles Marineris, climb up Olympus Mons and say hello to Curiosity on Gale Crater.

This release is a very early alpha; right now you can freely roam through a scaled down Mars; we're using the highest resolution map provided by NASA, which has 463 meters per pixel.

You can press `M` to see where you are on the global map.

Future ideas include:

  - a science-based (no dragons) survival mode on which you have to generate your oxygen and fuel, extract your water, grow your food, make martian bricks, etc

  - use voxel-sky to add the sun, phobos and deimos
  
  - open Google Mars in your location
  
  - add every lander and rover ever sent to Mars and put them at their correct locations
  
  - allow player to fly in "tourism" mode
